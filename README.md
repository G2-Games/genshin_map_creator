# Genshin Map Creator

Simply creates a `jpg` and `png` of the full up to date Genshin Impact map, sourced from the [official online interactive map.](https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/).

To run, simply run `getMap.py` with python

## Usage

```
python3 getMap.py [Map ID] [Overlay IDs]

Example:

python3 getMap.py 2 "1,2"
```

The overlay IDs are the "layers" of the map, currently I didn't make a good way to grab all of them.
